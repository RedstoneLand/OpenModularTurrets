OpenModularTurrets
==================

Repo for OpenModularTurrets for Minecraft. It adds modular turrets, walls and fences that can be used to defend your base from players and mobs. This mod supports the ingame wiki mod (IGWMod) from Minemaarten and has most information available through it so we recommend to use that one.  

Creating issue tickets:
=======================

If a you create a new issue that: 

1. Duplicates a previous ticket's issue(s) OR 
2. Is unreadable (grammatically or otherwise) OR
3. Does not make sense (Logically or otherwise) OR
4. Is a crash issue without a proper stack trace OR
5. Is new functionality request (New content, CR or otherwise)

the ticket will not be considered and be closed immediately. Make absolutely sure that the ticket you post adheres to the above.

For new functionality requests, please contact one of the devs directly, or clone the repo and get your hands dirty. This project is, after all, open source.
Additionally, for mod compatability request we have 3 requirements:

1. The mod we should do compatability for should not be inactive
2. It should be possible to contact one of the authors directly (from dev to dev)
3. Obviously, the mod in question should be on the same version as OMT
  
Dev-Builds are available here (be careful, those are experimental and can break your save): [Click here](https://jenkins.ironhide.de/job/OpenModularTurrets/)
